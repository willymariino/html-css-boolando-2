## Project Overview

This repository contains an introductory exercise focused on building a basic e-commerce product grid layout using HTML and CSS. The primary objective of this project is to develop foundational skills in CSS, specifically in the areas of grid and flexbox layouts, absolute and relative positioning, and interactive image overlay effects.

## Key Features

- **Grid Layout**: Product cards are displayed in a grid structure using calculated widths and consistent spacing between items.
- **Absolute and Relative Positioning**: Promotional labels, such as discount badges and sustainability tags, are positioned over product images using absolute positioning within relatively positioned containers.
- **Image Overlay Effects**: Each product image incorporates a hover effect that seamlessly transitions to an alternate image, implemented through CSS transitions for a smooth user experience.
